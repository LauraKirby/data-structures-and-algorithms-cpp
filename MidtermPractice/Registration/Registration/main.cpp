/*

 Class "Student" to represent a student in a course registration software given by a class called Course. 
 
 Many courses have an enrollment cap due to resource limitations.
 Course
 
 
 If the course is full, a prospective student has to wait in a so called "wait-list". 
 
 Assuming you have access to Student and Course classes (you do not have to write these):
    - implement a wait-list using the most suitable data structure based on so far what we have learned in the class.
    - Write a driver program to:
        - create a wait-list of 5 Students
        - demonstrate how a Student be entered into the wait-list 
        - how wait-listed student gets an enrollment opportunity.
