/* 
 Write three methods to do the following on a binary tree:

 1. traverse along the left side of the tree and print the values: printLeft
 2. traverse along the right side of the tree and print the values: printRight
 3. print only the leaves of a tree: printLeaves
 4. in each of the above cases, analyse the time complexity of your program for the best and worst cases in terms of the height, h of the tree and write it as a comment in your method
